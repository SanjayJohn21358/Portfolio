### Description of Projects:
#### Calculating Hours:
A function that accepts an uncleaned data file (output from a google form that logs DJ volunteering hours) as an input and produces a .csv file that shows each DJ and the hours they have worked for each category, as well as indicating whether they have satisfied their requirements for the quarter. Uses Python and Pandas.

#### Communication Tower Planning:
Assigned from ECE 143, this is an individual project that deals with solving a problem by designing classes with constraints with a visual component. Uses Python.

#### Data Visualization Machine Learning Project (FIFA Dataset):
Assigned from ECE 143, this is a group project that scrapes 20000 rows of data with 48 fields from a website, performs visual analysis on the data, and uses Support Vector Machines to calculate important features necessary for classification. The main aim of this project is to create a presentation that helps football coaches and scouts make better decisions about how to find and train players, as well as assess their current team. Uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Bokeh, Beautiful Soup
